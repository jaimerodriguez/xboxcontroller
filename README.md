# Xbox Controller

This is just a reference InputManager.asset file for Xbox controller on Unity.

I find it useful for reminding me value ranges for axis and mappings of the buttons (to KeyCode's in Unity).

### Usage Tips:
- To add the InputManager.asset into a project, copy it to the *ProjectSettings* folder in your project. 
- This only has input for xbox, so most likely you will still need to add standard axis for other input modules.
